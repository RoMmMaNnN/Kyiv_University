# Java Programming Labs – Semester 1 (KPI)

This repository contains my lab assignments for the first semester of **Algorithms and Data Structures**, focused on **Java programming** at **Kyiv Polytechnic Institute**. These labs demonstrate the use of procedural programming techniques to implement foundational algorithmic logic.

The purpose of this repository is to present structured solutions to core algorithm types including linear, branching, looping, and text-processing tasks.

## Folder Overview

- **Lab1 - Linear Algorithms** – Arithmetic operations and sequential logic
- **Lab2 - Branching Algorithms** – Conditional logic using `if`, `else`, and `switch`
- **Lab3 - Looping Algorithms** – Iterative constructs: `for`, `while`, and `do-while`
- **Lab4 - Text Processing Algorithms** – String manipulation and character-based operations
- **RGR - Matrix Processing Coursework** – A coursework project involving input/output and matrix-based algorithm design

## Key Concepts Covered

- Control flow and logic operations  
- Conditionals and branching  
- Loop structures and iteration  
- String processing and character data  
- Basic I/O and matrix data structures  

## How to Run

Use any Java-compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA) or compile via terminal:

```bash
javac Lab*.java
java Lab*.Main


Replace Lab* with the relevant folder and Main with the correct file name.

## Notes

Each lab focuses on a particular algorithmic pattern or structure.

All code is educational, designed for clarity and practice.

Coursework involves integrating learned concepts in a matrix-processing task.
