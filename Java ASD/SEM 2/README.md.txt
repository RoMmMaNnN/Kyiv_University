# Java Programming Labs – Semester 2 (KPI)

This repository contains my lab assignments for the second semester of **Algorithms and Data Structures**, implemented in **Java** at **Kyiv Polytechnic Institute**. These labs transition from procedural programming to object-oriented principles and data structures.

The purpose of this repository is to showcase solutions that involve object modeling, collections, and graph-related algorithms using Java’s standard libraries and paradigms.

## Folder Overview

- **Lab1 - Objects, Classes, and Their Functionality** – Introduction to OOP: constructors, methods, and encapsulation  
- **Lab2 - Java Collections: Linked Lists** – Implementing and working with custom and built-in linked lists  
- **Lab3 - Java Collections Overview** – Exploring Lists, Sets, Maps, and data handling patterns  
- **Lab4 - Java Collections Advanced** – Deeper use of collections with algorithmic problem-solving  
- **RGR - Graph Algorithms and Dynamic Programming Coursework** – Graph traversal, dynamic programming, and file I/O integration in a full project

## Key Concepts Covered

- Object-oriented design  
- Java collections framework  
- Linked lists and dynamic structures  
- File I/O and project modularity  
- Graph algorithms and dynamic programming  

## How to Run

Compile and run using Java CLI or any Java-compatible IDE:

```bash
javac LabX/*.java
java LabX.MainClass

## Notes

Each lab focuses on a particular algorithmic pattern or structure.

All code is educational, designed for clarity and practice.

Coursework involves integrating learned concepts in a matrix-processing task.
