# C Programming Labs – Semester 1 (KPI)

This repository contains my lab assignments for the first semester of **C programming** at **Kyiv Polytechnic Institute**. Each lab explores core concepts of the C language through hands-on tasks and practical code examples.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate my progression in structured programming using C, including working with strings, control statements, pointers, file I/O, and basic data structures.

## Folder Overview

- **Labal-Introducing C** – Introduction to C, basic syntax, input/output, simple programs
- **Laba2 - Character Strings, Operators, Expressions, and Statements** – Using character data, operators, and control expressions
- **Laba3 - Control Statements Looping** – Looping mechanisms: `for`, `while`, and `do-while`
- **Laba4 - Control Statements** – Decision-making: `if`, `switch`, and logical control
- **Laba5 - Character Input/Output and Input Validation** – Working with `getchar()`, `scanf()`, and input checking
- **Laba6 - Reviewing Functions** – Declaring and using functions, scope and return values
- **Laba7 - Reviewing Functions 2** – Advanced function usage, parameter passing
- **Laba8 - Pointers: A First Look** – Introduction to pointers and memory addresses
- **Laba9 - Pointers** – More pointer manipulation and pointer arithmetic
- **Laba10 - Functions and Arrays** – Using arrays in functions, array-pointer relationships
- **Laba11 - Character Strings and String Functions** – `strlen`, `strcpy`, and working with character arrays
- **Laba12 - Program Organization** – Modular code, headers, separating logic and interface
- **Laba13 - File Input/Output** – Reading from and writing to files using `fopen`, `fscanf`, etc.
- **Laba14 - Structures, Unions, Enumerations, Dynamic Memory Allocation** – Basic data structures and heap memory management
- **Chess** – A project task (likely game-related), implementing logic in C
- **Sort Methods** – Implementation of various sorting algorithms

## Key Concepts Covered

- Input/Output operations  
- Control structures (branching and loops)  
- Arrays and strings  
- Functions and recursion  
- Pointers and memory  
- File handling  
- Structures and data abstraction  

## How to Run

Use any C compiler (like GCC):

gcc -Wall task*.c -o task*
./task*


Some files might require command-line input or text file redirection. Refer to the comments within each task for usage instructions.

## Notes

- Each lab is self-contained and named according to its topic.  
- Files are organized for clarity and ease of understanding.  
- All code is academic — feel free to explore, reuse, or refactor for practice.
