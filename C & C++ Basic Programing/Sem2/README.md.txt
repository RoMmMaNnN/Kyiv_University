# C++ Programming Labs – Semester 2 (KPI)

This repository contains my lab assignments for the second semester, focused on **C++ programming** at **Kyiv Polytechnic Institute**. These labs demonstrate a progression from basic object-oriented principles to more advanced topics such as templates, polymorphism, and design patterns.

The purpose of this repository is to showcase practical applications of C++ through structured, well-commented tasks and coursework.

## Folder Overview

- **Laba1 - Simple Abstract Data Structures** – Introductory examples of ADTs like stacks and queues
- **Laba2 - An Overview of C++** – Basic syntax, classes, and streams
- **Laba3 - An Overview of C++ Clumsy Stuff** – Exploring corner cases and less intuitive C++ behavior
- **Laba4 - Design and Implementation of the Markov Chain Algorithm** – Implementing a text-based probabilistic model
- **Laba5 - Arrays, Pointers, and References** – Dynamic memory, pointer/reference usage in OOP
- **Laba6 - Function Overloading** – Using overloaded functions for flexibility and reusability
- **Laba7 - Introducing Operator Overloading** – Creating intuitive syntax with custom operators
- **Laba8 - Inheritance** – Understanding and implementing class hierarchies
- **Laba9 - Introducing the C++ I/O System** – Advanced input/output techniques
- **Laba10 - Advanced C++** – RAII, smart pointers, and modern best practices
- **Laba11 - Run-time Polymorphism** – Using virtual functions and dynamic dispatch
- **Laba12 - Templates and Exception Handling** – Generic programming and robust error handling
- **Laba13 - Run Time Type Identification and the Casting Operators** – Working with `typeid`, `dynamic_cast`, and safe casting
- **Laba14 - Namespaces, Conversion Functions, and Miscellaneous Topics** – Organizing large codebases, implicit/explicit conversions
- **Masyu Puzzle – CourseWork** – A full coursework project implementing logic and algorithms for solving the Masyu puzzle

## Key Concepts Covered

- Object-oriented programming principles  
- Function and operator overloading  
- Inheritance and polymorphism  
- Dynamic memory and pointers  
- File I/O and exception handling  
- Templates and generic programming  
- Namespaces and casting mechanisms  

## How to Run

Use any C++ compiler (like `g++`):

g++ -Wall task*.cpp -o task*
./task*


Some files may require user input or file redirection. Please check code comments for usage details.

## Notes

- Each lab is named according to its subject for easy navigation.  
- All code is academic and written for learning and demonstration.  
- The coursework project showcases integration of various techniques covered in labs.
